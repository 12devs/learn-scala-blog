        "\n" +
        "The tech giant said it was aiming to protect all customers, especially those in countries where phones are routinely obtained by police or criminals.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Apple said it will change the default settings in the iPhone operating system to cut off communication through the charging port when a phone has not been unlocked for more than a hour.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Forensic companies use the port to get around the security provisions that limit how many password guesses can be made before the device freezes them out or erases data.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "The change will mean that after the hour passes, the technique will no longer work.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Several forensic companies have been marketing their machines to law enforcement agencies around the world - selling them for thousands of dollars, and offering per-phone prices as low as $50 (£38).\n" +

        "Apple began working on the USB issue before learning it was popularly used by police\n" +

        "\n" +
        "“We have the greatest respect for law enforcement, and we don’t design our security improvements to frustrate their efforts to do their jobs.\"\n" +

        "Security researchers estimate that the changes to the iPhone's operating system code could cut access to devices by as much as 90%.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Apple has been a prominent opponent of demands from authorities for legislation to be created that forces technology companies to maintain access to users' devices.",
